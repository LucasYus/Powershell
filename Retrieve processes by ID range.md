## Explanation by parts

## Function Definition:
```
function dameid($id, $numero)
```
Defines a PowerShell function named dameid with two parameters: $id (threshold ID) and $numero (number of processes to retrieve).

## Retrieve Processes:
```
Get-Process
```
Retrieves all running processes on the system using Get-Process.

## Sort Processes by ID:
```
| Sort-Object Id
```
Sorts the list of processes in ascending order based on their IDs (Id property).

## Filter Processes by ID:
```
| Where-Object Id -gt $id

```
Filters the sorted list to include only those processes whose IDs (Id property) are greater than the specified $id.

## Select Top Processes:
```
| Select-Object -First $numero
```
Selects the first $numero processes from the filtered list. These are the processes whose IDs exceed the specified threshold $id.

## Function Invocation:
```
dameid 1110 5
```
Calls the dameid function with arguments 1110 (as the threshold ID) and 5 (as the number of processes to retrieve). It executes the function and outputs the selected processes.

# All the code
```
function dameid($id, $numero)
{
    Get-Process | Sort-Object Id | Where-Object Id -gt $id | Select-Object -First $numero
}

dameid 1110 5
